Starting this Django project felt overwhelming and a bit intimidating since I didn’t have much prior experience or knowledge about web development. 

At first, I struggled with basic setup tasks, such as creating and activating a virtual environment, installing Django correctly, and knowing where to run commands in PowerShell. 

I often felt confused about the sequence of steps and worried about making mistakes. 

To get through these challenges, I relied heavily on watching the recordings from GClass, checking YouTube tutorials, looking up online resources, and a little bit of help from AI to clarify commands and troubleshoot errors. Following these resources made me realize how everything actually works, even though I still don’t fully understand all the details. 

I saw how templates, views, and URLs connect, and how the project folder is organized. 

I also learned, for the first time, how to use Git to push my project to GitHub. 

I still feel like a beginner, but at least now I have a clearer idea of how things work and how to follow the steps to make a Django project run.
